# Readme

**The aim of this project is to have an easy to use tool to do story mapping on a simple (draft) level.**

## Spark plug for this project
In my case the developer team works often with [jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) regarding user
stories, bugs, etc. To get an overview I used to do story mapping with post-it notes on a wall. But not always you have a wall available for this :(. Furthermore at some point you have to transfer your real-world post-it notes to jira-tickets. This is in some way bothersome. 

I search for a way to make the story mapping digital plus get rid of the manual typewriting to get jira-tickets. And
  here we are :) 

This project is based on: https://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/ and currently **only supports the Google Chrome browser.**
